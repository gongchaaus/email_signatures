Directly Modifying the Signature Files

1. Locate Signature Files:
In Finder, press Command + Shift + G to open the Go to Folder window.
Type ~/Library/Mail/V7/MailData/Signatures/ and press Enter. The V7 might vary based on your version of Mail; it could be V6, V8, etc.
2. Modify the Signature File:
Open the .mailsignature files with a plain text editor. One of these files will correspond to the signature you wish to modify.
Replace the HTML content in the file with your new HTML code. Make sure not to change the metadata at the top of the file.
3. Lock the Signature File:
To prevent Mail from overwriting your changes, right-click the file in Finder, select Get Info, and check the Locked box.
4. Restart Mail App:
Quit and reopen Mail to apply the changes.
5. Create a new Signature
Uncheck the “Always match my default message font” option if necessary.
Copy from the previous signature and save
